    <h6>Description of yourself: For the past years of my life I can say that
                                    I am a person who is quite unsure of oneself.
                                    An individual who is creative in a way that I 
                                    express myself through drawing, I draw portraits and stuff.
                                    I am also quite friendly when it comes to people who are nice :).
                                    I was also once a kid who was curious about computers and here I am still full of questions.
